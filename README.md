# Clustering-High-dimensional-Noisy-Categorical-Data
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a computationally efficient spectral based algorithm to cluster high-dimensional noisy
categorical (nominal or ordinal) data, developed in "Clustering High-dimensional Noisy Categorical Data"  by Zhiyi Tian, Jiaming Xu, and Jen Tang.  To compare the finite-sample performance of our algorithm with that of Kmodes (Huang, 1997), K-modes shuffle, HD vector (Zhang et al., 2006), and SpectralCAT (David and Averbuch, 2012), the MATLAB implementation of those algorithms are also posted.
